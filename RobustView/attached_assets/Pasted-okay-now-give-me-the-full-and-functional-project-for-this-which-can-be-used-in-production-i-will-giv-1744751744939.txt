Project 5: Multi-Asset Portfolio Management System Objective: Create a comprehensive portfolio management system that uses different Python data structures to organize, analyze, and report on a multi-asset investment portfolio. Requirements: 1. Create a portfolio using nested dictionaries with at least 8 securities across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, ETFs, etc.) including: o For each security: ticker symbol, purchase price, current price, quantity, purchase date, asset class, and sector o At least 3 different asset classes and 4 different sectors 88Practical Python For Effective Algorithmic Trading o 2. Implement functions to: o Calculate the total portfolio value o Calculate the allocation percentages by asset class and sector o Identify the best and worst performing securities o Generate a report of positions that are up or down more than 5% 3. Use appropriate data structures: o Dictionaries for storing the portfolio and security information o Lists for tracking purchase history or price changes o Tuples for storing fixed information like (ticker, asset_class, sector) o Sets to find overlaps between different groupings (profitable securities, securities in a particular sector, etc.) 4. Create a watchlist of potential securities to add to the portfolio and implement set operations to: o Find securities in your watchlist that would complement your existing portfolio (not duplicate sectors) o Identify which watchlist securities match your current holdings' sectors 5. Output a formatted summary showing portfolio diversification, performance metrics, and potential rebalancing needs.
