A comprehensive web application for managing and analyzing multi-asset investment portfolios. Built with Python and Flask, this project demonstrates how to use different data structures to organize financial data as covered in Chapter 5 of [Practical Python for Effective Algorithmic Trading](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F3S8FQ7C).

## ‚ú® Features

- **Beautiful Dashboard**: Modern, responsive design with Bootstrap 5
- **Multi-Asset Support**: Track stocks, ETFs, bonds and other asset classes
- **Portfolio Analysis**: View allocation by asset class and sector with interactive charts
- **Performance Metrics**: Identify best/worst performers and positions exceeding thresholds
- **Watchlist Management**: Find complementary securities to improve diversification
- **Rebalancing Suggestions**: Get actionable recommendations to maintain target allocations

## üîç Usage

1. **Dashboard**
   - View portfolio summary with key metrics
   - Analyze asset allocation and sector diversification
   - Track performance with interactive charts

2. **Portfolio Management**
   - See detailed information on all holdings
   - Identify best and worst performing assets
   - Get rebalancing suggestions based on target allocations

3. **Watchlist Analysis**

## üìä Technical Implementation

The system is built on several core concepts from Chapter 5 of [Practical Python for Effective Algorithmic Trading](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F3S8FQ7C):

- **Dictionaries**: Nested dictionaries for storing portfolio and security data
- **Lists**: For tracking purchase history and sorted performance metrics
- **Tuples**: For representing immutable data like purchase records
- **Sets**: For efficient lookups and finding relationships between securities

The web application extends these concepts with:

- **Flask Backend**: Provides routes and handles data processing
- **Plotly Visualizations**: Creates interactive financial charts
- **Bootstrap Frontend**: Delivers a responsive, modern user interface
